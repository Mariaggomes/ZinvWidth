# Event Selection and Utilities for High-Energy Physics Analysis

This repository provides scripts and tools to streamline the analysis of high-energy physics data, including event selection, utility functions, and geometric transformations. Below is an overview of the repository's structure:

## Repository Structure

- **`Event_Selection(Ptmiss_region).ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook focused on event selection for Monte Carlo datasets.
- **`Event_Selection-DATA(Ptmiss_region).ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook focused on event selection for collision data.
- **`dpoa_utilities.py`**: A Python script containing utility functions for luminosity masking and dataset file management.
- **`geometry.py`**: A Python script with geometric transformations and calculations.
- **`plots.ipynb`**: Applies event weights and generates visualizations.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Ensure that libraries like `numpy`, `awkward`, and `numba` are installed. Use the following command to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebooks or scripts**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Or execute the Python scripts in your analysis pipeline.
